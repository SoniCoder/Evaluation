About the program

The Program is divided into three seperate programs.

1. docMaker.cpp - Arbitrary sized random documents generator implemented as a MPI program.

The generated executable needs to run on every node and it will automagically create all the documents as per specified in the source.
To create documents it randomly picks words from a specified wordlist until the specified wordcount is reached.

To change the number of documents created and the size of each document, modify docwlen and docn variables inside docMaker.cpp appropriately.

The convention for naming documents is "doc-i" where i goes from 0 to n-1 where n is document count.

2. indexer.cpp - 

3. indexMerger.cpp
