* Doing critical tasks first is better because of the following reasons:

1.	More critical tasks may accumulate over time, so we may not be able to do atleast one of em in time or do them improperly.
2.	Psychologically, we tend to spend more time on tasks that have far deadlines and thus manage to do them better.

How we do things the way we do:

1.	Only through feelings/emotions(Addicts) - Auto Mode - Very Dangerous, you plan for immediate good feel but not for the long term goals.

2.	Semi-Automatic(Where most people are): You know the direction but occasionally you'd drift off to the world of automatic(emotions).

3.	Almost Manual(Perhaps the best and where most successful people lie): Everything is scheduled but deaadlines are a bit easy and more far hence easier to achieve.

3. Completely Manual: Everything done via scheduled deadlines. Very Inflexible, lots of interrupts and hence not optimum performance.
