![There are limited amount of resources .... if there were no government, everyone would have to have their own farms or borrow it from those with farms. This could be avoided by using gold/currency.]

When we waste resources, there will be more demand of that particular resource and hence its cost will be increased and will not be available to some poor families. Since, the resource is produces with the previous rate, the rate will be increased ... now to increase the rate of its production, time will be needed, but since the initial rate was just so as to fulfill the demands .... now since demands have increased price will be accordingly increased so as to meet the demands of high payers preferentially, hence some people will always be left void of that resource.

This problem will be solved if the wastage rate is kept constant.
