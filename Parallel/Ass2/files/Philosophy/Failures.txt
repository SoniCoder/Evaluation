Should you feel guilty after a failure?

Absolutely no - Guilt is a feeling meant for knowing and correcting reason for a failure. As soon as you know the reason, the guilt is gone.

Why do failures occur?
Failures occur when a procedure is not correct and hence it gives the wrong results.
If one knows the full procedure beforehand that is guaranteed to work on any input, there won't be any failure.
But since examinations contain tasks whose sub-routines we are not aware of, results will not be 100% mostly.
