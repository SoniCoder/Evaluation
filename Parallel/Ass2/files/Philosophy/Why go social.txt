1. When you are likely to get something back (usually when someone is looking)

This is a very clear reason for going social, people value those more who are more social.

2. When nobody is looking - Making someone feel happy can never be considered wrong.

Jealousy(Feeling bad when someone else's happy) was invented to strive for more but it was most likely meant for constructive purposes (i.e. for uplifting ourselves) and not for malicious reasons. It is because of this constructive jealousy that we are capable of learning faster in competitive environment.

Why to share happiness?

In this world, all the happiness we've gained comes from the contribution of others. Therefore, one's happiness comes from the society, so as a member of the society its our duty to share this happiness with others.

Consider a world where no one wanted to share happiness and would like to see others neutral/sad, they would never do anything that would make others happy and might try to make em sad in this world ..... hence this individual will never be happy but now he may realize this and would like to step forward for sharing happiness so that someone else can be made happy and this goes on and thats the way this world works and which is why we are known as a social animal.
