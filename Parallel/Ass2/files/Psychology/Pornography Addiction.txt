* Mass Dopamine Release Route
* Brain remembers the feeling and how it was constructed and tries to construct it somehow later whenever there is a need for dopamine release.
* This certainly consumes processing time and hinders other tasks not only for that voluntary recall but also during other tasks in absence of the feeling (i.e. the feeling is tried to be recalled).
* Evidences show from personal experiences as well as from other that it significantly weakens the memory connections.
*Tends to lower faith in yourself and GOD
