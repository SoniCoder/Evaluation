Why take notes?
Well you can't remember it all forever.

Who are these notes for?
Ans. Meant for the writer but if these are written in such as way that they help the write even after a long time, these can also be understood by others. Then these notes will be called as good. Such notes would be void of any pre-knowledge and everything can be understood from fundamentals.
